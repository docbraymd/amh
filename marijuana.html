        Medical marijuana (medical cannabis) is increasingly used as a symptom-targeted therapy for chronic pain,
        insomnia, anxiety, nausea, spasticity, appetite loss, and other difficult-to-treat problems. It is also widely
        misunderstood. Some patients overestimate benefits and underappreciate risks; others dismiss it entirely due
        to decades of stigma and policy barriers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide is written for sophisticated patients and physician learners. It explains: (1) what medical marijuana is
        (and is not), (2) where evidence is strongest versus weak, (3) how to evaluate root causes and contributing factors
        so cannabis is not used as a substitute for foundational health, (4) practical protocols for safer, disciplined use
        when appropriate, and (5) what the new Schedule III policy shift likely changes (and does not change) in real-world care.

        <strong>High-yield summary</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list">
          <li><strong>Medical marijuana is a pharmacologically active therapy</strong>, not a vitamin. It can help selected symptoms, but it can also harm the heart, brain, lungs, and mental health in predictable ways.</li>
          <li><strong>Best-supported uses</strong> (overall): chronic pain (especially neuropathic), chemotherapy-related nausea/vomiting, MS-related spasticity, and specific epilepsy syndromes for purified CBD (FDA-approved).</li>
          <li><strong>Common “real-world” uses</strong> (evidence mixed): insomnia, anxiety, PTSD, appetite issues, migraine, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel symptoms, and “stress relief.” Benefits vary widely by person, product, and dosing discipline.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety depends on route and dose</strong>: inhalation creates rapid peaks and more impairment; oral products have delayed onset and higher overdose risk if patients re-dose too early.</li>
          <li><strong>THC is the primary intoxicating/impairing component</strong>; CBD is generally non-intoxicating but still pharmacologically powerful and can cause important drug interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule III (policy shift)</strong> is most likely to expand research and regulatory pathways. It does <em>not</em> automatically make dispensary products “FDA-approved medicine,” and it does not eliminate the need for medical oversight.</li>
          <li><strong>AMH philosophy</strong>: cannabis is a tool—sometimes helpful—but it should not replace core prevention, lifestyle, root-cause work, and thoughtful conventional care.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="alert-box">
        <strong>Safety first</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          If you have chest pain, severe shortness of breath, fainting, new neurologic symptoms (weakness, facial droop, speech trouble),
          severe paranoia/hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or uncontrolled vomiting with dehydration, seek urgent evaluation.

      <h3 id="what-it-is">What “medical marijuana” includes</h3>

      <p>
        “Medical marijuana” is not one thing. It is a category of products that contain cannabinoids—primarily
        <strong>THC</strong> (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and <strong>CBD</strong> (cannabidiol)—plus dozens of other
        phytocannabinoids and aromatic compounds called <strong>terpenes</strong>. In the body, cannabinoids interact with
        the <strong>endocannabinoid system (ECS)</strong>, a widespread signaling network that helps regulate homeostasis:
        pain perception, sleep-wake patterns, appetite, mood, stress reactivity, immune signaling, and autonomic tone.
      </p>

      <h4>Common product categories (and why they behave differently)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Inhaled flower or vaporized extracts</strong>: onset in minutes, peak quickly, wears off faster. Higher impairment risk and (for smoke) lung irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral edibles/capsules</strong>: onset typically 45–120 minutes, lasts longer. Highest “accidental overdose” risk when people re-dose too soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Sublingual tinctures</strong>: intermediate onset (often 15–45 minutes), easier dose control than edibles.</li>
        <li><strong>Topicals</strong>: local effects for some pain conditions; usually minimal intoxication unless highly concentrated and absorbed systemically.</li>
        <li><strong>High-potency concentrates</strong>: not ideal for most medical use; higher tolerance, dependence, anxiety/paranoia risk, and cognitive side effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Quality and labeling: the non-negotiable foundation</h4>
      <p>
        If a patient chooses to use cannabis medically, the product must be verifiable and contaminant-tested.
        A <strong>Certificate of Analysis (COA)</strong> should confirm potency and screen for contaminants.
        Safety panels commonly emphasize a “Big Four”: pesticides, heavy metals, microbials (mold/pathogens), and residual solvents.
      </p>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Practical rule</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          If a product does not have a readable COA with potency + contaminant testing, it is not appropriate for medical use—especially for
          immunocompromised patients, patients with lung disease, or anyone with complex medication regimens.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms and common use-cases</h3>
      <p>
        Medical marijuana is usually pursued because a patient has symptoms that persist despite standard therapy, or because conventional
        options have unacceptable side effects. Below are the most common medical scenarios where patients consider cannabis—and the key
        clinical nuance for each.
      </p>

      <h4>1) Chronic pain (especially neuropathic and “mixed mechanism” pain)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Symptom patterns</strong>: burning, electric pain, tingling, hypersensitivity, pain out of proportion to imaging, pain that flares with stress/sleep loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Best-fit scenarios</strong>: neuropathy (diabetes, post-herpetic), radiculopathy, fibromyalgia-like central sensitization, cancer-related pain adjuncts.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: cannabis can modulate pain perception; it usually does not fix mechanical drivers (severe osteoarthritis, instability, fracture, tumor).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2) Sleep problems (insomnia, night awakenings, “wired but tired”)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Potential benefit</strong>: some patients fall asleep faster, feel less pain, and reduce nighttime awakenings.</li>
        <li><strong>Common failure mode</strong>: tolerance develops; sleep architecture can worsen; rebound insomnia occurs when stopping daily THC-heavy use.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: if obstructive sleep apnea is untreated, sedating agents (including cannabis) can worsen risk and daytime fatigue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3) Anxiety, stress reactivity, PTSD symptoms</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Potential benefit</strong>: low-dose THC and/or CBD can reduce somatic anxiety for some people.</li>
        <li><strong>Common failure mode</strong>: higher THC doses can worsen anxiety, panic, paranoia, and derealization—especially in predisposed individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: cannabis should not replace trauma-informed therapy, structured stress regulation, sleep repair, and (when needed) conventional psychiatric care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4) Nausea/vomiting (chemotherapy-related) and appetite issues</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Evidence support</strong>: cannabinoids can help chemotherapy-associated nausea/vomiting and appetite in selected contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Important caution</strong>: chronic heavy use can cause <strong>cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome</strong> (cyclic vomiting relieved by hot showers, often misdiagnosed for months).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5) Spasticity (multiple sclerosis) and movement symptoms</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Evidence support</strong>: certain cannabinoid preparations reduce spasticity severity for some MS patients.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: dose-limiting side effects (dizziness, cognitive slowing) are common.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>6) Seizure disorders (CBD-specific, physician-supervised)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Strongest evidence</strong>: purified CBD for specific epilepsy syndromes (FDA-approved indication).</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: requires liver monitoring and careful drug interaction management; not equivalent to dispensary products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="redflags">Red flags, who should avoid, and high-risk situations</h3>

      <div class="alert-box">
        <strong>Do not start (or stop and reassess) without clinician oversight if you have:</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Pregnancy or breastfeeding</strong> (fetal/neonatal exposure risk; safety is not established).</li>
          <li><strong>History of psychosis, schizophrenia-spectrum illness, or severe bipolar instability</strong> (THC can precipitate/worsen symptoms).</li>
          <li><strong>Unstable cardiovascular disease</strong> (recent MI, unstable angina, poorly controlled arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension).</li>
          <li><strong>High-risk occupations</strong> (driving, aviation, heavy machinery, safety-critical work), or any scenario where impairment can harm others.</li>
          <li><strong>Active substance use disorder</strong> or high-risk dependence pattern (including daily high-dose THC use with loss of control).</li>
          <li><strong>Severe chronic lung disease</strong> if the plan involves inhalation (especially smoked products).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Impairment and safety rules that prevent predictable harm</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>No driving while impaired.</strong> Consider conservative “buffer windows” and avoid next-day impairment (especially with edibles).</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid smoking as a medical route</strong> when possible. If inhalation is used, prefer regulated vaporization methods over combustion.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid combining with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and other sedatives</strong> unless explicitly managed by a clinician (fall/over-sedation risk).</li>
        <li><strong>Keep products locked and childproofed</strong>; accidental pediatric ingestion is a major preventable hazard.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis and clinical evaluation (before starting)</h3>

      <p>
        Cannabis is a symptom therapy. The quality of the outcome depends on whether we understand the underlying diagnosis and contributing
        drivers. A disciplined evaluation reduces the risk of masking serious disease, reduces side effects, and improves the chance that
        cannabis—if used—can be used at the lowest effective dose.
      </p>

      <h4>Core pre-start questions (the “clinical decision funnel”)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>What symptom are we targeting?</strong> Pain? Sleep onset? Night awakenings? Nausea? Anxiety spikes? Spasticity?</li>
        <li><strong>What is the working diagnosis?</strong> Neuropathic pain vs inflammatory pain vs mechanical pain; primary insomnia vs sleep apnea; GAD vs PTSD; etc.</li>
        <li><strong>What has been tried?</strong> Lifestyle foundations, physical therapy, behavioral interventions, first-line medications, and risk-reduction strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the safety profile?</strong> Cardiovascular risk, psychiatric risk, fall risk, medication interactions, occupational constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>What does “success” look like?</strong> We define objective targets (sleep latency, pain score, function, reduced opioid dose, fewer panic episodes).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Medication and interaction screening (non-optional)</h4>
      <p>
        Both THC and CBD can interact with liver enzymes and drug transporters. CBD is particularly notable for interaction potential,
        and clinically meaningful interactions are best described with anticoagulants, anti-seizure medicines, immunosuppressants, and
        some psychiatric medications. If you are on complex medications, do not self-manage cannabis initiation.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Practical monitoring examples (depends on your case)</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Anticoagulants/antiplatelets</strong>: watch for bleeding/bruising; INR monitoring if warfarin; clinician oversight for DOACs.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-seizure medicines</strong>: sedation, liver enzymes (CBD), level changes; special caution with clobazam and similar agents.</li>
          <li><strong>Immunosuppressants</strong>: tacrolimus/cyclosporine interactions can be serious and require coordinated care.</li>
          <li><strong>Psychiatric medicines</strong>: additive sedation or anxiety amplification depending on product and dose.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 id="drivers">Root causes and contributing factors (why symptoms happen)</h3>

      <p>
        Many patients come to cannabis after years of symptoms. That often means there are multiple drivers:
        metabolic, inflammatory, mechanical, sleep-related, psychological, and lifestyle-mediated. Cannabis may reduce suffering
        while we repair foundations—but it should not become a substitute for the repair process.
      </p>

      <h4>Pain: common “upstream” contributors to address</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Mechanical drivers</strong>: poor biomechanics, deconditioning, joint degeneration, spinal stenosis, old injuries, weak posterior chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic inflammation</strong>: insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, fatty liver, high-glycemic diet patterns, low fiber intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Nervous system sensitization</strong>: chronic stress, trauma load, poor sleep, persistent inflammation, catastrophizing loops.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient insufficiency</strong>: magnesium depletion risk, omega-3 deficiency patterns, low protein in older adults, micronutrient gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication contributors</strong>: statin myalgias, poorly tolerated neuropathy agents, rebound headaches from frequent analgesics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Insomnia and anxiety: common drivers to correct first</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Circadian disruption</strong>: inconsistent wake time, low morning light exposure, excessive evening light/screen load.</li>
        <li><strong>Stimulant load</strong>: caffeine timing, nicotine, energy drinks, certain pre-workout products.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep apnea and breathing issues</strong>: snoring, witnessed apneas, morning headaches, unrefreshing sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress physiology</strong>: chronic sympathetic dominance, rumination loops, unresolved trauma, spiritual disconnection.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol</strong>: fragmented sleep and heightened anxiety, often mistaken as “helpful” because it sedates initially.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why this matters</h4>
      <p>
        If we reduce inflammation, restore sleep architecture, improve conditioning and biomechanics, and repair stress physiology,
        many symptoms that drive cannabis use improve. When cannabis is still appropriate, those improvements often allow a lower dose,
        fewer side effects, and a lower risk of dependence.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scheduleIII">Schedule III update: what changes and what does not</h3>

      <p>
        In late 2025, federal policy moved toward reclassifying marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III through executive action and
        agency processes. The practical implications are complex:
      </p>

      <h4>What “Schedule III” is expected to change (most likely)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Research access and volume</strong>: fewer structural barriers to high-quality clinical trials and pharmacology research.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical legitimacy</strong>: acknowledges medical use potential; may improve clinical standardization over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory pathways</strong>: can encourage development of consistent, pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid medicines.</li>
        <li><strong>Downstream economic effects</strong>: may alter tax/regulatory burdens for parts of the industry, potentially affecting pricing and product standardization over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What “Schedule III” does NOT instantly change</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Dispensary products do not become FDA-approved</strong> simply because scheduling changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Individual state medical programs remain state-governed</strong>, with state rules, product availability, and documentation requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety still depends on dose, product quality, and patient selection</strong>. Policy does not eliminate cardiovascular, psychiatric, or interaction risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Impairment law and workplace rules</strong> are still complicated; drug testing and safety-sensitive restrictions may remain unchanged.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>How AMH interprets the shift</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          This is a “watershed moment” for research and policy, but it is not an endorsement of reckless use.
          Cannabis remains a potent modulator of physiology and must be used with education, precision, and oversight—especially in patients
          with heart disease risk, psychiatric vulnerability, or complex medication lists.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="plan">Step-by-step improvement plan (practical protocols)</h3>

      <p>
        This is the clinical pathway that tends to produce the best outcomes: maximize root-cause repair and safety while using cannabis
        in a structured, measurable way—if it is used at all.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 1: Define the target and the success metric</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Choose one primary symptom target</strong> (sleep onset, neuropathic pain, spasticity, nausea) rather than “everything.”</li>
        <li><strong>Pick 1–3 measurable outcomes</strong> (sleep latency, awakenings/night, pain score + function, rescue medication frequency).</li>
        <li><strong>Set a time horizon</strong>: if no meaningful benefit after careful titration, stop rather than escalating indefinitely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 2: Fix foundations first (often reduces or eliminates the need)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Sleep</strong>: consistent wake time, morning light, evening screen reduction, treat apnea, reduce alcohol.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement</strong>: daily walking + resistance training progression; physical therapy if mechanical pain drivers exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: reduce ultra-processed foods; increase protein adequacy, omega-3 intake, fiber; stabilize glycemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress regulation</strong>: breath training, prayer/meditation, psychotherapy when indicated, community and meaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 3: Choose the safest route and product profile for your goal</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Prefer non-combustion routes</strong> (tincture/oral) when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with CBD-forward or balanced formulations</strong> if anxiety, panic, or cognitive sensitivity exists.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid high-potency THC concentrates</strong> for medical beginners; they increase tolerance and adverse effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a COA-verified product</strong> for potency and contaminant screening.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 4: Dosing discipline (“start low, go slow, don’t chase”)</h4>
      <p>
        The most common cannabis complication in medically minded patients is not “addiction” at first—it is dosing chaos:
        re-dosing too early, escalating potency, and losing a stable baseline. A disciplined micro-titration approach reduces adverse events.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Typical conservative starting patterns (general education)</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Oral THC</strong>: consider starting at very low doses (often 1–2.5 mg THC) at night; hold the dose steady for several days before adjusting.</li>
          <li><strong>CBD</strong>: non-intoxicating but not “inactive.” Low-to-moderate daily dosing is often tried first in anxiety-prone patients; higher doses require interaction and liver monitoring considerations.</li>
          <li><strong>Sublingual tincture</strong>: allows smaller dose steps than many edibles and may be easier for precision titration.</li>
          <li><strong>Never re-dose edibles quickly</strong>: delayed onset is why people unintentionally overconsume.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Step 5: Build a safety and interaction plan</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Medication list review</strong> before starting (especially anticoagulants, anti-seizure meds, immunosuppressants, sedatives).</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular safety</strong>: avoid heavy THC use if you have known CAD risk; avoid use around strenuous exertion; watch palpitations, chest pressure, near-syncope.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health safety</strong>: if anxiety/paranoia occurs, stop and reassess dose and THC exposure; prioritize CBD-forward profiles and non-pharmacologic stress regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence prevention</strong>: avoid “all-day THC.” Prefer targeted, time-limited, symptom-specific use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 6: Re-evaluate, taper, or stop</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Benefit without drift</strong>: if the dose keeps rising to maintain benefit, reassess the strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Function matters more than sensation</strong>: success is better sleep/function, not “feeling something.”</li>
        <li><strong>Periodic tolerance breaks</strong> may reduce escalation and side effects in some patients (clinician-guided).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="treatments">Conventional treatments (including FDA cannabinoid medicines)</h3>

      <p>
        Many patients do not realize that cannabinoid-based medicines exist in FDA-regulated forms for specific indications. These may offer
        more consistent dosing and safety oversight than dispensary products. In addition, conventional treatments for pain, insomnia, and anxiety
        remain important—especially when root causes are addressed in parallel.

        <li><strong>Chronic pain</strong>: physical therapy; resistance training; weight optimization; neuropathic agents (clinician-selected); topical agents; interventional approaches when clearly indicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Insomnia</strong>: CBT-I, circadian correction, apnea treatment, targeted short-term medications when appropriate, avoiding long-term dependence traps.</li>
        <li><strong>Anxiety/PTSD</strong>: psychotherapy, structured stress regulation, carefully chosen medications when indicated, and treatment of comorbid depression or sleep disorders.</li>
        <li><strong>Nausea</strong>: guideline-based antiemetics; evaluation for GI pathology; avoid missing serious disease.</li>

      <h3 id="integrative">Integrative options (supportive, evidence-aware)</h3>

      <p>
        Integrative care is not “instead of” science—it is the disciplined use of lifestyle, nutrition, and selected supplements
        where plausible mechanisms and evidence justify a trial, while respecting safety and interaction limits.
        For cannabis users, integrative strategies often reduce required dose and improve symptom durability.

            Magnesium supports neuromuscular relaxation, stress physiology, sleep quality, and may reduce cramps.
            Some cannabis-focused integrative protocols emphasize magnesium support for frequent users.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Typical use</div>
          <div>
            Often taken in the evening for sleep support. Benefits typically assessed over 2–4 weeks.
            Start low to avoid GI intolerance.

      <h3 id="costs">Cost considerations</h3>
      <p>
        Cannabis costs vary dramatically by state, formulation, potency, and frequency. Many dispensary products are not covered by insurance.
        A structured plan prevents common cost traps: escalating potency, buying multiple overlapping products, and using cannabis as a substitute
        for high-ROI foundational interventions.
      </p>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Prioritize high-ROI interventions first</strong>: sleep repair, movement/strength progression, nutrition quality, stress regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Use one product at a time</strong> when starting; avoid “stacking” multiple THC products that make outcomes hard to interpret.</li>
        <li><strong>Expect a wide monthly range</strong>: occasional targeted use can be modest; daily high-potency use can become expensive quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision reduces cost</strong>: lowest effective dose, targeted timing, clear success metrics, and periodic reassessment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

      <h4>Is medical marijuana “safe”?</h4>
      <p>
        “Safe” depends on patient selection, route, dose, and context. Low-dose, targeted use in the right patient can be reasonably safe.
        Daily high-THC use—especially via inhalation or concentrates—raises risks: dependence, cognitive impairment, anxiety/paranoia, and
        cardiovascular effects in predisposed individuals.
      </p>

      <h4>What is the biggest mistake patients make?</h4>
      <p>
        Re-dosing too early (especially with edibles), escalating potency rapidly, and using cannabis as a replacement for foundational health.
        Another common error is ignoring drug interactions—especially with anticoagulants and seizure medications.
      </p>

      <h4>Does cannabis increase heart attack or stroke risk?</h4>
      <p>
        Emerging data associate frequent cannabis use with higher cardiovascular risk signals in population studies, and mechanistically THC can
        raise heart rate, alter autonomic tone, and affect vascular function. If you have known cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors,
        do not self-manage cannabis; choose conservative strategies or avoid THC-heavy products.
      </p>

      <h4>Why do some people get anxious or paranoid?</h4>
      <p>
        THC can amplify threat sensitivity and perceptual distortion—especially at higher doses, in sleep deprivation, and in people with a predisposition
        to panic, trauma reactivity, or psychosis-spectrum vulnerability. CBD-forward approaches and lower THC exposure reduce risk, but do not eliminate it.
      </p>

      <h4>What about “CBD only” products?</h4>
      <p>
        CBD is usually non-intoxicating and can be helpful for some symptoms, but it still has real pharmacology. It can cause sedation, GI upset,
        and clinically meaningful drug interactions in some cases. “CBD only” does not mean “no risks.”
      </p>

      <h4>Can cannabis cause vomiting?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. Chronic heavy use can cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS): cyclical vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and a classic pattern
        of relief with hot showers. The definitive treatment is stopping cannabis.
      </p>

      <h4>Will it show up on a drug test?</h4>
      <p>
        THC exposure commonly triggers positive tests for weeks in some users, especially with frequent use. CBD products may contain trace THC.
        If testing matters for employment, legal, or safety reasons, assume risk unless verified otherwise and discussed with a clinician.
      </p>

      <h4>What is the AMH “bottom line”?</h4>
      <p>
        Cannabis can be useful when used as a targeted tool with disciplined dosing and high-quality products. It is not a substitute for lifestyle
        medicine, and it can cause significant harm in predictable high-risk patients. Our goal is to improve health at the root while relieving
        suffering safely and intelligently.
