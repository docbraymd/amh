        Medical marijuana (medical cannabis) is a pharmacologically active therapy used for symptom relief—most commonly
        chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, spasticity, and appetite loss. It is also widely misunderstood.
        Some patients overestimate benefits and underappreciate risks; others dismiss it entirely due to decades of stigma and policy barriers.

        <strong>High-yield summary</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list">
          <li><strong>Medical cannabis is real pharmacology.</strong> It can help selected symptoms, but it can also harm the heart, brain, lungs, and mental health in predictable ways.</li>
          <li><strong>Whole-plant cannabis is not FDA-approved medicine.</strong> Rescheduling does not equal FDA approval or standardized dosing.</li>
          <li><strong>Best-supported uses</strong> (overall): chronic pain (especially neuropathic), chemotherapy-related nausea/vomiting, MS-related spasticity, and specific epilepsy syndromes for purified CBD (FDA-approved).</li>
          <li><strong>Common “real-world” uses</strong> (evidence mixed): insomnia, anxiety, PTSD, appetite issues, migraine, fibromyalgia, GI symptoms. Benefit varies widely by person, product, and dosing discipline.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety depends on route and dose</strong>: inhalation creates rapid peaks and more impairment; oral products have delayed onset and higher “too much, too fast” risk.</li>
          <li><strong>THC drives intoxication/impairment</strong>; CBD is generally non-intoxicating but still pharmacologically potent and can create important drug interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>AMH philosophy</strong>: cannabis is a tool—sometimes helpful—but it should not replace root-cause work, lifestyle medicine, and thoughtful conventional care.</li>

      <h3 id="scheduleIII">Schedule III update: what changes and what does not</h3>

      <p>
        In 2025, marijuana was rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act—an important federal policy shift.
        Schedule I drugs are defined as having no accepted medical use and high abuse potential; Schedule III drugs have accepted medical use and
        moderate-to-low potential for physical dependence (with potential for psychological dependence). This places marijuana in a regulatory category
        similar to certain controlled medicines used in standard practice.
      </p>

      <h4>What this is expected to change (most likely)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Research expansion</strong>: fewer structural barriers to higher-quality clinical trials, including real-world evidence models and clearer standards for studying cannabinoids.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory pathways</strong>: increased incentives to develop standardized, pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid therapies.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical legitimacy</strong>: formal recognition that medical utility exists for some conditions, which can improve education and professional competency over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What this does NOT instantly change</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Whole-plant cannabis does not become FDA-approved</strong> simply because scheduling changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispensary products are still variable</strong> in potency, purity, and formulation; “standard dosing” remains limited for most indications.</li>
        <li><strong>Physicians generally still cannot “prescribe” whole-plant cannabis</strong> like an FDA medication; in most state programs clinicians certify/recommend within a state regulatory framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and impairment realities remain</strong>: dose, route, patient selection, and interactions still determine risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Workplace, driving, and safety-sensitive restrictions</strong> can remain stringent even when medical use is legal.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>AMH interpretation</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          Rescheduling is a “research and standards” inflection point, not a blanket endorsement. The clinical goal remains the same:
          relieve suffering while improving health at the root and avoiding preventable harm.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-it-is">What “medical marijuana” includes</h3>

      <p>
        “Medical marijuana” is not one thing. It is a category of products that contain cannabinoids—primarily
        <strong>THC</strong> (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and <strong>CBD</strong> (cannabidiol)—plus dozens of other
        phytocannabinoids and aromatic compounds called <strong>terpenes</strong>. In the body, cannabinoids interact with
        the <strong>endocannabinoid system (ECS)</strong>, a widespread signaling network involved in homeostasis:
        pain perception, sleep-wake patterns, appetite, mood, stress reactivity, immune signaling, and autonomic tone.
      </p>

      <h4>Common product categories (and why they behave differently)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Inhaled flower or vaporized extracts</strong>: onset in minutes, rapid peak, shorter duration. Higher impairment risk and (for smoke) lung irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral edibles/capsules</strong>: onset typically 45–120 minutes, longer duration. Highest “accidental overdose” risk when people re-dose too soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Sublingual tinctures</strong>: intermediate onset (often 15–45 minutes), easier dose control than many edibles.</li>
        <li><strong>Topicals</strong>: local effects for some pain conditions; usually minimal intoxication unless highly concentrated and absorbed systemically.</li>
        <li><strong>High-potency concentrates</strong>: generally not ideal for most medical use; higher tolerance, dependence, anxiety/paranoia risk, and cognitive side effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Quality and labeling: the non-negotiable foundation</h4>
      <p>
        If a patient chooses to use cannabis medically, the product must be verifiable and contaminant-tested.
        A <strong>Certificate of Analysis (COA)</strong> should confirm potency and screen for contaminants.
        A practical safety panel includes: pesticides, heavy metals, microbials (mold/pathogens), and residual solvents.
      </p>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Practical rule</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          If a product does not have a readable COA with potency + contaminant testing, it is not appropriate for medical use—especially for
          immunocompromised patients, patients with lung disease, or anyone with complex medication regimens.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="evidence">Evidence snapshot: top medical uses (and how big the benefit is)</h3>

      <p>
        Evidence quality varies by condition, product type, and study design. Across many indications, benefit—when present—is often <strong>modest</strong>
        and side effects are common. The strongest, most reproducible evidence for cannabinoids falls into a small number of categories.
      </p>

      <h4>1) Chronic pain (especially neuropathic pain)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>How often it is used</strong>: chronic pain is the most common reason for state medical cannabis registrations, often representing a large share of enrolled patients.</li>
        <li><strong>What the evidence shows</strong>: on average, studies show a modest improvement—often roughly a <strong>0.5 to 1.0 point reduction</strong> on a 0–10 pain scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical meaning</strong>: compared with placebo, roughly <strong>~10% more patients</strong> achieve a meaningful improvement—but many do not, and adverse effects are frequent.</li>
        <li><strong>Best-fit pain patterns</strong>: neuropathic pain (burning, electric, tingling), mixed mechanism pain, and pain amplified by poor sleep/stress physiology.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2) Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>What the evidence shows</strong>: cannabinoids can help when standard antiemetics are inadequate; this is one of the clearest evidence-based uses.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnitude</strong>: approximately <strong>1 in 6</strong> patients may achieve complete control in some study contexts when cannabinoids are used appropriately.</li>
        <li><strong>Best practice</strong>: consider FDA-approved cannabinoid medicines when appropriate, and avoid unstructured self-dosing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3) Multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>What the evidence shows</strong>: cannabis-based medicines can reduce spasticity; patients often report more improvement than what is captured on exam measures, but benefit is present in both.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical boundary</strong>: dizziness, fatigue, and cognitive slowing are common dose-limiting effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4) Seizure disorders (CBD-specific, physician-supervised)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Strongest evidence</strong>: purified CBD (prescription) for specific syndromes (e.g., Lennox-Gastaut, Dravet, tuberous sclerosis complex).</li>
        <li><strong>Important distinction</strong>: pharmaceutical-grade CBD is not equivalent to over-the-counter or dispensary CBD products.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: liver enzymes and drug interactions are central to safe use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5) HIV/AIDS-related appetite loss (cachexia)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>What the evidence shows</strong>: synthetic THC has FDA approval for appetite stimulation in this context.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole-plant evidence</strong>: often anecdotal or based on smaller studies; careful risk-benefit discussion is required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="limited">Other conditions: limited or insufficient evidence</h3>

      <p>
        Many state programs include conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, irritable bowel symptoms, and neurodegenerative disorders.
        However, for many of these, evidence is limited, inconsistent, or insufficient to support routine medical use as a standard-of-care therapy.
        “Legal” does not automatically mean “well-proven.”
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>AMH clinical framing</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          When evidence is weak, cannabis should be treated like a bounded, time-limited therapeutic experiment:
          define the symptom target, choose the safest route, start very low, titrate slowly, track outcomes objectively, and stop if benefit is not clear.
          In most cases, foundational care (sleep, nutrition, movement, stress regulation, addressing medical drivers) has a higher long-term return.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms and common real-world use-cases</h3>

      <h4>Chronic pain (neuropathic, central sensitization, mixed mechanism)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Patterns</strong>: burning/electric pain, tingling, hypersensitivity, pain flares with stress/sleep loss, fibromyalgia-like features.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary</strong>: cannabis may modulate pain perception; it rarely fixes structural drivers (instability, severe OA, fracture, tumor).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sleep problems (insomnia, night awakenings, “wired but tired”)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Potential benefit</strong>: reduced sleep latency, fewer awakenings, pain relief that indirectly improves sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Common failure mode</strong>: tolerance develops; sleep architecture can worsen; rebound insomnia occurs when stopping daily THC-heavy use.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary</strong>: untreated sleep apnea and alcohol use are common “hidden drivers” that cannabis does not fix and may worsen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Anxiety, stress reactivity, PTSD symptoms</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Potential benefit</strong>: low-dose THC and/or CBD can reduce somatic anxiety for some people.</li>
        <li><strong>Common failure mode</strong>: higher THC doses can worsen anxiety, panic, paranoia, and derealization—especially in predisposed individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary</strong>: cannabis should not replace trauma-informed therapy, sleep repair, and structured stress regulation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Nausea, appetite, and GI symptom clusters</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Potential benefit</strong>: anti-nausea effects in selected scenarios; appetite support in some chronic illness contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Key caution</strong>: chronic heavy use can cause <strong>cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome</strong> (cyclic vomiting relieved by hot showers). Definitive treatment is stopping cannabis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="redflags">Red flags, who should avoid, and high-risk situations</h3>

      <div class="alert-box">
        <strong>Do not start (or stop and reassess) without clinician oversight if you have:</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Pregnancy or breastfeeding</strong> (fetal/neonatal exposure risk; safety is not established).</li>
          <li><strong>History of psychosis, schizophrenia-spectrum illness, or severe bipolar instability</strong> (THC can precipitate/worsen symptoms).</li>
          <li><strong>Unstable cardiovascular disease</strong> (recent MI, unstable angina, poorly controlled arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension).</li>
          <li><strong>High-risk occupations</strong> (driving, aviation, heavy machinery, safety-critical work), or any scenario where impairment can harm others.</li>
          <li><strong>Active substance use disorder</strong> or high-risk dependence pattern (daily high-dose THC with loss of control).</li>
          <li><strong>Severe chronic lung disease</strong> if the plan involves inhalation (especially smoked products).</li>
          <li><strong>Adolescents/young adults</strong> (developing brain vulnerability; avoid routine THC exposure unless a specialized medical indication exists and is supervised).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Impairment and safety rules that prevent predictable harm</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>No driving while impaired.</strong> Use conservative “buffer windows,” especially with edibles.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid smoking as a medical route</strong> when possible. If inhalation is used, prefer regulated vaporization methods over combustion.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid combining with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and other sedatives</strong> unless explicitly managed by a clinician.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep products locked and childproofed</strong>; accidental pediatric ingestion is a major preventable hazard.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis and clinical evaluation (before starting)</h3>

      <p>
        Cannabis is primarily a symptom-targeted tool. The quality of the outcome depends on whether we understand the underlying diagnosis and
        contributing drivers. A disciplined evaluation reduces the risk of masking serious disease, reduces side effects, and improves the chance that
        cannabis—if used—can be used at the lowest effective dose.
      </p>

      <h4>Core pre-start questions (the “clinical decision funnel”)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>What symptom are we targeting?</strong> Pain? Sleep onset? Night awakenings? Nausea? Anxiety spikes? Spasticity?</li>
        <li><strong>What is the working diagnosis?</strong> Neuropathic vs inflammatory vs mechanical pain; primary insomnia vs sleep apnea; GAD vs PTSD; etc.</li>
        <li><strong>What has been tried?</strong> Lifestyle foundations, physical therapy, behavioral interventions, first-line medications, and risk-reduction strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the safety profile?</strong> Cardiovascular risk, psychiatric risk, fall risk, medication interactions, occupational constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>What does “success” look like?</strong> Define objective targets (sleep latency, awakenings, pain/function, rescue medication use).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Medication and interaction screening (non-optional)</h4>
      <p>
        Both THC and CBD can interact with liver enzymes and drug transporters. CBD is particularly notable for interaction potential.
        Clinically meaningful interactions are best described with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), certain anti-seizure medicines,
        immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus), and some psychiatric medications. If you are on complex medications, do not self-manage cannabis initiation.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Practical monitoring examples (depends on your case)</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Anticoagulants/antiplatelets</strong>: watch for bleeding/bruising; INR monitoring if warfarin; clinician oversight for DOACs.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-seizure medicines</strong>: sedation, liver enzymes (CBD), level changes; special caution with clobazam and similar agents.</li>
          <li><strong>Immunosuppressants</strong>: tacrolimus/cyclosporine interactions can be serious and require coordinated care.</li>
          <li><strong>Psychiatric medicines</strong>: additive sedation or anxiety amplification depending on product and dose.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 id="drivers">Root causes and contributing factors (why symptoms happen)</h3>

      <p>
        Many patients arrive at cannabis after years of symptoms. That often means there are multiple drivers:
        metabolic, inflammatory, mechanical, sleep-related, psychological, and lifestyle-mediated. Cannabis may reduce suffering
        while we repair foundations—but it should not become a substitute for the repair process.
      </p>

      <h4>Pain: common upstream contributors to address</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Mechanical drivers</strong>: poor biomechanics, deconditioning, joint degeneration, spinal stenosis, old injuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic inflammation</strong>: insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, fatty liver, high-glycemic diet patterns, low fiber.</li>
        <li><strong>Nervous system sensitization</strong>: chronic stress, trauma load, poor sleep, persistent inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient insufficiency</strong>: magnesium depletion patterns, omega-3 insufficiency, protein inadequacy in older adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication contributors</strong>: statin myalgias, rebound headaches from frequent analgesics, poorly tolerated neuropathy agents.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Insomnia and anxiety: common drivers to correct first</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Circadian disruption</strong>: inconsistent wake time, low morning light exposure, excessive evening light/screen load.</li>
        <li><strong>Stimulant load</strong>: caffeine timing, nicotine, energy drinks, certain pre-workout products.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep-disordered breathing</strong>: snoring, witnessed apneas, morning headaches, unrefreshing sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress physiology</strong>: sympathetic dominance, rumination loops, unresolved trauma, spiritual disconnection.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol</strong>: fragmented sleep and heightened anxiety, often mistaken as “helpful” because it sedates initially.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="consequences">Consequences of chronic use (benefit drift, dependence, cognition, health)</h3>

      <p>
        The most common long-term pattern that creates harm is not “one-time use.” It is <strong>frequent, escalating THC exposure</strong>
        that gradually shifts a person into tolerance, cognitive drag, mood instability, and reduced ability to sleep or relax without cannabis.
      </p>

      <h4>Common side effects (frequency varies by study and duration)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Dizziness</strong>: often reported in a meaningful minority of users (reported ranges vary widely).</li>
        <li><strong>Drowsiness/sedation</strong>: a common limiting effect, especially with THC-heavy products or combined sedatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Nausea</strong>: can occur acutely; paradoxically, chronic heavy use can drive cyclic vomiting (CHS).</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary cognitive impairment</strong>: attention, reaction time, and short-term memory can be measurably affected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Higher-consequence risks</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Cannabis use disorder (CUD)</strong>: a portion of regular users develop dependence with difficulty cutting down despite negative consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health destabilization</strong>: higher-potency THC increases risk of paranoia, panic, and psychosis-spectrum symptoms in vulnerable individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular strain</strong>: THC can raise heart rate and alter blood pressure; risk is more concerning in patients with existing heart disease or significant risk factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Respiratory harm</strong>: smoking increases airway irritation and chronic bronchitis symptoms; vaping introduces additional risks depending on device and additives.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional impairment</strong>: falls in older adults, work errors, driving impairment, and reduced executive functioning in complex real-world tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Dependence prevention principle</strong>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          Avoid “all-day THC.” Prefer targeted, time-limited use tied to a single symptom goal, at the lowest effective dose, with periodic reassessment.
          If the dose must keep rising to maintain benefit, reassess the strategy and prioritize root-cause repair.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="plan">Step-by-step improvement plan (practical protocols)</h3>

      <p>
        This pathway tends to produce the best outcomes: maximize root-cause repair and safety while using cannabis
        in a structured, measurable way—if it is used at all.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 1: Define the target and the success metric</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Choose one primary symptom target</strong> rather than “everything.”</li>
        <li><strong>Pick 1–3 measurable outcomes</strong> (sleep latency, awakenings/night, pain + function, rescue medication frequency).</li>
        <li><strong>Set a time horizon</strong>: if no meaningful benefit after careful titration, stop rather than escalating indefinitely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 2: Fix foundations first (often reduces or eliminates the need)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Sleep</strong>: consistent wake time, morning light, evening screen reduction, treat apnea, reduce alcohol.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement</strong>: daily walking + resistance training progression; PT when mechanical drivers exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: reduce ultra-processed foods; increase protein adequacy, omega-3 intake, fiber; stabilize glycemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress regulation</strong>: breath training, prayer/meditation, therapy when indicated, community and meaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 3: Choose the safest route and product profile for your goal</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Prefer non-combustion routes</strong> (tincture/oral) when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Start CBD-forward or balanced</strong> if anxiety, panic, or cognitive sensitivity exists.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid high-potency concentrates</strong> for beginners; they increase tolerance and adverse effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Use COA-verified products</strong> for potency and contaminant screening.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 4: Dosing discipline (“start low, go slow, don’t chase”)</h4>
      <p>
        The most common complication is dosing chaos: re-dosing too early, escalating potency, and losing a stable baseline.
        A micro-titration approach reduces adverse events.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Conservative starting patterns (general education; individualized supervision recommended)</strong>
        <ul class="amh-list symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Oral THC</strong>: consider very low doses (often 1–2.5 mg THC) in the evening; hold steady for several days before adjusting.</li>
          <li><strong>CBD</strong>: non-intoxicating but not inert; interactions matter. Start low-to-moderate and reassess after 2–4 weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Sublingual tincture</strong>: allows smaller dose steps than many edibles and may be easier for precision titration.</li>
          <li><strong>Edibles</strong>: never re-dose quickly; delayed onset drives unintentional overconsumption.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Step 5: Build a safety and interaction plan</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Medication review</strong> before starting (especially anticoagulants, anti-seizure meds, immunosuppressants, sedatives).</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular safety</strong>: avoid heavy THC exposure with known CAD risk; watch palpitations, chest pressure, near-syncope.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health safety</strong>: if anxiety/paranoia occurs, stop and reassess dose and THC exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence prevention</strong>: avoid daily high-dose patterns; keep use targeted and measurable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 6: Re-evaluate, taper, or stop</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Function matters</strong>: success is better sleep/function, not “feeling something.”</li>
        <li><strong>Benefit without drift</strong>: if the dose keeps rising, reassess. More is often worse.</li>
        <li><strong>Periodic reassessment</strong>: consider planned breaks (clinician-guided) to reduce tolerance and dependence risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="treatments">Conventional treatments (including FDA cannabinoid medicines)</h3>

      <p>
        Some cannabinoid-based medicines exist in FDA-regulated forms for specific indications. These can offer more consistent dosing and safety oversight
        than dispensary products. Conventional evidence-based treatments remain important—especially when root causes are addressed in parallel.

      <h3 id="costs">Cost considerations</h3>
      <p>
        Cannabis costs vary dramatically by state, formulation, potency, and frequency. Most dispensary products are not covered by insurance.
        A structured plan prevents common cost traps: escalating potency, buying multiple overlapping products, and using cannabis as a substitute
        for high-ROI foundational interventions.
      </p>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Up-front costs</strong>: state registration and certification requirements vary; some states require periodic renewals and clinician documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Product costs</strong>: occasional targeted use is usually far less expensive than daily high-potency use, which can escalate rapidly.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision reduces cost</strong>: use one product at a time, lowest effective dose, targeted timing, and clear success metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider opportunity cost</strong>: consistent sleep repair, strength training, and nutrition upgrades often outperform escalating symptom therapies over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

      <h4>Is medical marijuana “safe”?</h4>
      <p>
        Safety depends on patient selection, route, dose, and context. Low-dose, targeted use in the right patient can be reasonably safe.
        Daily high-THC use—especially via inhalation or concentrates—raises risks: dependence, cognitive impairment, anxiety/paranoia,
        and cardiovascular effects in predisposed individuals.
      </p>

      <h4>What is the biggest mistake patients make?</h4>
      <p>
        Re-dosing too early (especially with edibles), escalating potency rapidly, and using cannabis as a replacement for foundational health.
        Another common error is ignoring drug interactions—especially with anticoagulants and seizure medications.
      </p>

      <h4>Does cannabis increase heart attack or stroke risk?</h4>
      <p>
        THC can raise heart rate and alter autonomic tone, and observational data raise concern for cardiovascular risk signals—especially in frequent users
        and those with existing heart disease. If you have known cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors, do not self-manage cannabis.
      </p>

      <h4>Why do some people get anxious or paranoid?</h4>
      <p>
        THC can amplify threat sensitivity and perceptual distortion—especially at higher doses, in sleep deprivation, and in people predisposed to panic,
        trauma reactivity, or psychosis-spectrum vulnerability.
      </p>

      <h4>What about “CBD only” products?</h4>
      <p>
        CBD is usually non-intoxicating and can be helpful for some symptoms, but it still has real pharmacology. Interactions and liver effects can matter in
        selected patients. “CBD only” does not mean “no risks.”
      </p>

      <h4>Can cannabis cause vomiting?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. Chronic heavy use can cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS): cyclical vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and relief with hot showers.
        The definitive treatment is stopping cannabis.
      </p>

      <h4>Will it show up on a drug test?</h4>
      <p>
        THC exposure commonly triggers positive tests for weeks in some users, especially with frequent use. CBD products may contain trace THC.
        If testing matters for employment, legal, or safety reasons, assume risk unless verified otherwise and discussed clinically.
      </p>

      <h4>What is the AMH “bottom line”?</h4>
      <p>
        Cannabis can be useful when used as a targeted tool with disciplined dosing and high-quality products. It is not a substitute for lifestyle
        medicine, and it can cause significant harm in predictable high-risk patients. Our goal is to improve health at the root while relieving
        suffering safely and intelligently.
