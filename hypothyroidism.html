        Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not producing (or your body is not effectively using) enough thyroid hormone
        to support normal metabolic function. Because thyroid hormone influences virtually every organ system, symptoms
        can be broad—fatigue, brain fog, constipation, weight gain, low mood, dry skin, hair changes, cold intolerance,
        menstrual changes, and more. In most cases, hypothyroidism is straightforward to diagnose and highly treatable.
        The best outcomes come from pairing the right medical therapy with practical lifestyle and integrative strategies
        that reduce inflammation, optimize nutrient status, improve hormone “conversion,” and improve medication absorption.

      <h3 id="overview">Overview and key points</h3>
      <p>
        The thyroid gland primarily produces two hormones: T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). T4 is largely a “storage”
        hormone; T3 is the more active form at the cellular receptor. Your pituitary gland regulates thyroid output using TSH
        (thyroid-stimulating hormone). When thyroid hormone levels fall, the pituitary increases TSH to stimulate the thyroid.
        For primary hypothyroidism (the most common type), the hallmark pattern is <strong>elevated TSH</strong> with
        <strong>low free T4</strong>. Hypothyroidism is common, and women are disproportionately affected over the lifespan.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>High-yield concept:</strong> In iodine-sufficient regions like the U.S., the most common root cause of primary hypothyroidism
        is <strong>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</strong>—an immune-driven inflammatory condition of the thyroid. Treating the hormone deficit is essential,
        but long-term symptom stability often improves when we also address immune drivers, gut health, nutrient status, sleep, and toxin exposure.
      </div>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Most common U.S. cause:</strong> Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (autoimmune inflammation and gradual thyroid injury).</li>
        <li><strong>Other common causes:</strong> thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, head/neck radiation, thyroiditis (postpartum or viral), and select medications.</li>
        <li><strong>Key treatment principle:</strong> normalize thyroid physiology and symptoms using the simplest effective approach (usually levothyroxine), then optimize absorption, conversion, and root contributors.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclinical hypothyroidism:</strong> mildly elevated TSH with normal free T4—often early thyroid strain; management depends on symptoms, antibodies, pregnancy plans, and cardiovascular risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Central hypothyroidism:</strong> rare; pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction can produce low/normal TSH despite low thyroid hormone—requires a different diagnostic lens.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Clinical note:</strong> Some people remain symptomatic despite “normal” TSH. Before escalating therapy, confirm:
        (1) correct diagnosis, (2) consistent medication timing and absorption, (3) no lab interference (especially biotin),
        and (4) no other conditions mimicking hypothyroid symptoms (sleep apnea, anemia/iron deficiency, depression,
        low vitamin B12, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, medication effects).
      </div>

      <h3 id="risk">Who is at higher risk</h3>
      <p>
        Risk is not destiny, but it guides how aggressively we screen, how we interpret mild abnormalities, and how closely we monitor.
      </p>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Women are substantially more likely than men to develop hypothyroidism across the lifespan.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Prevalence increases with age, and symptoms can be mistakenly attributed to “normal aging.”</li>
        <li><strong>Family history:</strong> A first-degree relative with thyroid disease increases risk and lowers the threshold for antibody testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Autoimmune clustering:</strong> Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, and other autoimmune diseases increase risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Pregnancy/postpartum:</strong> Thyroid physiology changes in pregnancy; postpartum thyroiditis can occur and sometimes becomes permanent hypothyroidism.</li>
        <li><strong>Prior thyroid treatment:</strong> Thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine, or head/neck radiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Lithium, amiodarone, interferon-based therapies, and some immunotherapies can affect thyroid function.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="physiology">Thyroid physiology: T4, T3, conversion, and reverse T3</h3>
      <p>
        Many treatment frustrations come from misunderstanding where “active hormone” actually comes from. Your thyroid makes mostly T4.
        Much of your usable T3 is produced outside the thyroid by converting T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues—especially the liver and gut.
        This is why gut health, nutrient status, inflammation, and stress physiology can meaningfully affect how you feel even when some labs appear “acceptable.”
      </p>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Practical translation:</strong> T4 is the supply line. T3 is the “active fuel.” Conversion efficiency and receptor responsiveness
        determine how much of that supply becomes usable energy.
      </div>

      <h4>T4 (thyroxine): the “storage/supply” hormone</h4>
      <p>
        T4 circulates in relatively higher amounts and has a longer half-life. It provides a stable reservoir that tissues can draw from.
      </p>

      <h4>T3 (triiodothyronine): the “active” hormone</h4>
      <p>
        T3 binds thyroid hormone receptors more strongly and drives a large share of the “metabolic effect”: warmth, energy, bowel motility,
        cognitive clarity, and lipid metabolism.
      </p>

      <h4>Reverse T3 (rT3): the “metabolic brake” (selective clinical use)</h4>
      <p>
        In states of physiologic stress—acute illness, inflammation, sleep deprivation, severe caloric restriction, injury, and sometimes chronic stress—
        the body may shift T4 metabolism toward reverse T3. Reverse T3 is an inactive form that can reflect a conservation response.
        Clinically, this may present as “functional hypothyroid” symptoms even when TSH and free T4 do not look dramatically abnormal.
      </p>

      <div class="alert-box">
        <strong>High-yield conversion blockers:</strong> chronic stress and elevated cortisol signaling, severe illness, rapid weight loss or very low-calorie dieting,
        systemic inflammation, nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron), and overtraining (especially high-intensity volume without recovery).
      </div>

      <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms and red flags</h3>
      <p>
        Hypothyroidism often develops slowly, and symptoms can overlap with common issues (stress, sleep deprivation, aging,
        overtraining, depression, iron deficiency). The most helpful pattern is a cluster of symptoms plus supportive labs.
      </p>

      <h4>Common symptoms (classic pattern)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Energy and metabolism:</strong> persistent fatigue, low stamina, feeling “slowed down,” cold intolerance, unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Brain and mood:</strong> brain fog, slower thinking, memory issues, low mood, anxiety, reduced motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin, hair, and connective tissue:</strong> dry/coarse skin, brittle nails, thinning hair, eyebrow thinning, puffiness (especially facial/periorbital).</li>
        <li><strong>GI:</strong> constipation, bloating, sluggish digestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Muscle and joints:</strong> cramps, aches, stiffness, weakness, reduced exercise tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiometabolic:</strong> slower heart rate, higher LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, reduced exercise capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproductive:</strong> heavy or irregular periods, fertility challenges, low libido; in pregnancy, untreated hypothyroidism can affect maternal and fetal health.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Symptoms that can indicate over-treatment (too much thyroid hormone)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li>palpitations, racing heart, tremor, anxiety/irritability</li>
        <li>insomnia, heat intolerance, sweating</li>
        <li>unexplained weight loss, frequent bowel movements</li>
        <li>new or worsening chest discomfort or shortness of breath</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert-box" id="red-flags">
        <strong>Red flags (seek urgent evaluation):</strong>
        confusion or marked sleepiness, severe weakness, fainting, chest pain, new significant shortness of breath,
        severe swelling, very slow heart rate, hypothermia, or inability to stay awake. These can represent severe hypothyroidism
        (rare but dangerous) or other urgent conditions that should not be managed at home.
      </div>

      <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis and what to test</h3>
      <p>
        Diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical assessment and blood testing. A high-quality thyroid evaluation does
        not rely on a single number. It starts with TSH and free T4, then adds targeted tests based on context (autoimmune risk,
        symptoms, pregnancy, medication history, and response to therapy).
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>The sensitivity of TSH (why small changes matter):</strong> TSH behaves like an “amplifier” of thyroid hormone signaling.
        This is one reason mild shifts in free hormone can produce larger shifts in TSH—and why stable medication timing and absorption are essential.
      </div>

      <h4>Core thyroid labs</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li>
          <strong>TSH:</strong> the most sensitive screening marker for primary hypothyroidism. Elevated TSH signals the pituitary is pushing the thyroid harder.
          Reference ranges vary by lab and age; interpretation should match symptoms and free hormone levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free T4:</strong> the unbound “available” T4. Low free T4 with high TSH confirms overt primary hypothyroidism. Normal free T4 with mildly high TSH suggests subclinical hypothyroidism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free T3 (selective use):</strong> not usually required for diagnosis, but can be helpful when symptoms persist despite therapy, when conversion concerns exist, or when evaluating certain nonstandard treatment approaches.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Autoimmune evaluation (very important in the U.S.)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab):</strong> often positive in Hashimoto’s; helps identify autoimmune etiology and predicts progression risk in subclinical cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Ab):</strong> can also support Hashimoto’s diagnosis; sometimes positive when TPO Ab is negative.</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h4>Iodine testing (when considering deficiency or excess)</h4>
      <p>
        Iodine assessment is challenging in individuals. <strong>Serum iodine</strong> is not a particularly reliable marker of iodine status for most clinical decision-making,
        because it is influenced by recent intake and does not consistently reflect tissue/thyroid iodine handling over time.
        When iodine status truly matters clinically (e.g., suspected deficiency or excess, complex dietary patterns, unusual exposure risk, pregnancy planning),
        the most useful approaches tend to be <strong>Urinary Iodine Concentration</strong> and/or <strong>thyroglobulin (Tg)</strong>, interpreted in context.
      </p>

      <div class="rx-card amh-rx-card">
        <div class="rx-header">
          <div class="rx-name">1) Urinary Iodine Concentration (UIC)</div>
          <div class="rx-type">TESTING</div>
        </div>
        <div class="rx-grid">
          <div class="rx-label">Why it matters</div>
          <div>
            UIC is the gold standard for evaluating iodine intake because roughly 90% of ingested iodine is excreted in urine.
            It primarily reflects recent iodine intake over the past few days.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Best method</div>
          <div>
            For individuals, a <strong>24-hour urine collection</strong> is preferred for accuracy but can be cumbersome.
            A <strong>spot urine</strong> (often adjusted for creatinine) can be used, but multiple samples (ideally 8–10 across different days)
            are typically needed to account for day-to-day variability and provide a more reliable estimate.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Interpretation (population-style thresholds)</div>
          <div>
            A median UIC of <strong>100–199 mcg/L</strong> indicates sufficiency in non-pregnant adults; <strong>150–249 mcg/L</strong> in pregnant women.
            Below <strong>100 mcg/L</strong> suggests deficiency (mild: 50–99, moderate: 20–49, severe: &lt;20).
            Values above <strong>300 mcg/L</strong> may indicate excess.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Limitations</div>
          <div>
            Not ideal as a one-and-done “deficiency diagnosis” for a single person because diet fluctuates.
            UIC is most powerful when repeated or when interpreted with clinical context and a thoughtful dietary/exposure history.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="rx-card amh-rx-card">
        <div class="rx-header">
          <div class="rx-name">2) Serum Thyroglobulin (Tg)</div>
          <div class="rx-type">TESTING</div>
        </div>
        <div class="rx-grid">
          <div class="rx-label">Why it matters</div>
          <div>
            Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by thyroid tissue. In iodine deficiency, Tg can rise as the thyroid is stimulated (often via TSH)
            and becomes more active or enlarges. Tg can be more sensitive to moderate or chronic iodine deficiency than thyroid hormones and can change
            within weeks to months after iodine intake adjustments.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Interpretation (context dependent)</div>
          <div>
            A median Tg below about <strong>13 mcg/L</strong> is often used as a marker of iodine sufficiency in children; similar cutoffs have been suggested for adults,
            but adult data are less robust and assay-dependent. Elevated Tg (often cited across a broader range such as ~13–40 mcg/L depending on assay)
            can correlate with deficiency, especially when combined with low UIC.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Advantages</div>
          <div>
            Useful for monitoring response to iodine intake changes and can complement UIC by reflecting longer-term status.
            Particularly helpful when TSH and thyroid hormones remain normal despite mild deficiency.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Limitations</div>
          <div>
            Results vary by assay method. <strong>Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Ab)</strong> can interfere (a meaningful minority of patients),
            so screening for Tg Ab is important when Tg is used for interpretation.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
<h4>Reverse T3 (rT3) testing (selective)</h4>
      <p>
        Reverse T3 testing is not routinely required. It is sometimes considered when symptoms persist despite apparently reasonable thyroid labs,
        particularly when there is significant physiologic stress, inflammation, overtraining, severe dieting, or chronic illness.
        If used, it should be interpreted cautiously and never as a stand-alone reason to escalate therapy without addressing foundational drivers.
      </p>

      <h4>Optimal vs. reference ranges (interpretation framework)</h4>
      <p>
        Lab “reference ranges” describe what is statistically common in a broad population, not necessarily what is optimal for you.
        Many symptomatic patients feel best with thyroid markers in the healthier portion of the reference range—provided we avoid over-treatment.
        Any target should be individualized, especially with aging, cardiovascular disease, and pregnancy.
      </p>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>TSH:</strong> often best tolerated in the lower half of the reference range for many symptomatic patients; clinical judgment matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Free T4:</strong> many patients feel better when free T4 is not at the bottom of the range, assuming safety and symptom response align.</li>
        <li><strong>Free T3:</strong> sometimes useful when symptoms persist, but interpretation should account for illness/stress physiology and conversion drivers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Supportive and “why you feel this way” testing</h4>
      <p>
        Hypothyroid symptoms are common in other conditions. If you are symptomatic, testing should also look for frequent
        co-travelers and “symptom mimics,” especially if thyroid labs are only mildly abnormal or if symptoms persist despite treatment.
      </p>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Lipid panel:</strong> hypothyroidism can raise LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.</li>
        <li><strong>CBC + ferritin/iron studies:</strong> iron deficiency can cause fatigue, hair loss, cold intolerance, and impaired thyroid hormone utilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin B12 and folate:</strong> low levels can cause fatigue, neuropathy, cognitive symptoms, and anemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> commonly low; relevant for immune balance and musculoskeletal symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP):</strong> liver and kidney function matter for conversion and overall physiology.</li>
        <li><strong>Glucose/A1c (and sometimes fasting insulin):</strong> insulin resistance can overlap with weight gain, fatigue, and inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Celiac screening (tTG-IgA with total IgA):</strong> higher prevalence in Hashimoto’s; untreated celiac can impair medication absorption and drive inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep apnea screening (clinical assessment ± home sleep test):</strong> common, underdiagnosed, and highly symptomatic.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Biotin warning (high-yield):</strong> High-dose biotin (often in “hair/skin/nails” products) can distort thyroid lab assays and produce misleading results.
        If you use biotin, disclose it and stop it in advance of thyroid labs per clinician guidance so results reflect true physiology.
      </div>

      <h4>When imaging is appropriate</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Thyroid ultrasound:</strong> useful if there is a goiter, asymmetry, nodules, swallowing discomfort, or concerning exam findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Pituitary evaluation:</strong> if central hypothyroidism is suspected (low free T4 with non-elevated TSH), additional pituitary hormones and sometimes MRI are appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="drivers">Root causes and contributing factors</h3>
      <p>
        In integrative care, we separate “root cause” from “contributors.” The root cause is the primary biological reason
        thyroid output is low (e.g., Hashimoto’s, post-surgical). Contributors are the factors that amplify symptoms, worsen antibody activity,
        impair conversion (T4 → T3), or interfere with medication absorption.
      </p>

      <h4>Common root causes</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:</strong> immune-mediated inflammation against thyroid tissue.</li>
        <li><strong>Iatrogenic hypothyroidism:</strong> thyroid removal or destruction (surgery, radioactive iodine, head/neck radiation).</li>
        <li><strong>Medication-associated:</strong> lithium, amiodarone, interferon therapies, and select immunotherapies can impair thyroid function.</li>
        <li><strong>Thyroiditis:</strong> postpartum or inflammatory thyroiditis can transition from hyperthyroid phases to hypothyroid phases.</li>
        <li><strong>Iodine deficiency (less common in the U.S.):</strong> globally common; in iodine-replete regions, excessive iodine supplementation can sometimes worsen thyroid autoimmunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Central hypothyroidism:</strong> pituitary/hypothalamic disease (rare).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key contributors that worsen symptoms or labs</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Medication absorption issues:</strong> taking thyroid hormone with coffee, food, calcium/iron/magnesium/zinc, fiber supplements, bile-acid binders, or some antacids can reduce absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>GI conditions:</strong> celiac disease, H. pylori, atrophic gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and significant dysbiosis can impair absorption and raise dose requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient deficits:</strong> iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin D, B12 (and sometimes folate) are common “limiting factors” for energy, hair, mood, and immune balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Chronic stress and sleep debt:</strong> can worsen fatigue and reduce resilience; may also influence conversion and inflammatory signaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation:</strong> overlaps strongly with weight gain, dyslipidemia, and fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental exposures:</strong> endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with iodine handling or thyroid hormone signaling; risk reduction is reasonable even when individual causality is hard to quantify.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="consequences">Consequences if untreated or undertreated</h3>
      <p>
        Untreated hypothyroidism is not only a “how you feel” issue. Over time it can influence cardiovascular risk,
        metabolic health, fertility/pregnancy outcomes, and cognitive function. The degree of risk depends on how severe
        and how prolonged the hormone deficiency is.
      </p>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Cardiometabolic:</strong> elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides; potential acceleration of atherosclerosis risk; reduced exercise capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurocognitive and mood:</strong> persistent brain fog, depressive symptoms, and reduced productivity/quality of life.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproductive:</strong> menstrual irregularity, fertility challenges; in pregnancy, inadequate thyroid hormone can affect maternal wellbeing and fetal development.</li>
        <li><strong>Musculoskeletal:</strong> weakness, cramps, reduced performance; in severe/prolonged cases, increased risk of certain muscle enzyme elevations.</li>
        <li><strong>Severe hypothyroidism (rare):</strong> can progress to a life-threatening state with hypothermia, slowed breathing, bradycardia, and altered mental status.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Balance matters:</strong> Over-treatment also carries real risk—particularly atrial fibrillation and bone loss in susceptible individuals.
        The goal is not “as much thyroid hormone as possible,” but the smallest dose and strategy that restores stable physiology and function.
      </div>

      <h3 id="pregnancy">Pregnancy and postpartum considerations</h3>
      <p>
        Thyroid management during pregnancy is time-sensitive. Early fetal neurodevelopment depends on maternal thyroid hormone availability.
        If you are planning pregnancy, already pregnant, or postpartum, your thyroid plan should be explicitly tailored and monitored.
      </p>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Pregnancy action framework:</strong> optimize thyroid status pre-conception, act early when pregnancy is confirmed, and monitor more frequently
        using pregnancy-specific targets and clinician guidance.
      </div>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Pre-conception:</strong> aim for stable thyroid labs and symptom control before pregnancy whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>When pregnancy is confirmed:</strong> if you are already on levothyroxine, many clinicians increase the dose early and then confirm with labs—because requirements often rise quickly. Contact your clinician promptly for individualized instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> thyroid testing is typically performed more often in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester and after any dose change.</li>
        <li><strong>Postpartum thyroiditis:</strong> the postpartum period can be a vulnerable window for thyroid inflammation. Symptoms may mimic anxiety, depression, or sleep deprivation. Some cases resolve; some evolve into persistent hypothyroidism.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="plan">Step-by-step improvement plan</h3>

      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Practical plan:</strong> Most people improve fastest by getting fundamentals right first: confirm the diagnosis, optimize medication timing/absorption,
        stabilize sleep and protein intake, and address common “symptom mimics.” Then add targeted nutrition and selective supplements.
        Finally, address deeper autoimmune and gut drivers (and toxic load) when needed.
      </div>

      <h4>Phase 1 (Weeks 0–2): Precision first</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Confirm the core labs:</strong> at minimum TSH + free T4; add antibodies if Hashimoto’s is likely.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove lab interference:</strong> disclose supplements (especially biotin) and medication timing to your clinician before labs.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication timing discipline:</strong> take consistently with water on an empty stomach; choose either morning (well before food/coffee) or bedtime (well after food) and keep it consistent.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a true separation buffer:</strong> hard separation from calcium/iron/magnesium/zinc, fiber supplements, and soy-based protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Start symptom tracking:</strong> energy, mood, constipation, hair shedding, cold intolerance, resting pulse, sleep quality. Weekly notes outperform memory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 2 (Weeks 2–8): Foundations that move the needle</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Protein and micronutrient density:</strong> aim for adequate protein and whole-food variety; avoid “empty calorie” patterns that worsen fatigue and insulin resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory food pattern:</strong> prioritize vegetables (especially cooked), legumes, nuts/seeds, olive oil, fish or other omega-3 sources, and minimally processed foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Crucifers and soy (practical approach):</strong> cruciferous vegetables are healthy; emphasize cooked forms if intake is high. Soy can be part of a healthy diet—just avoid taking it near thyroid medication.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep and circadian rhythm:</strong> consistent sleep/wake times; morning light exposure; reduce late-night screens; treat sleep apnea if present.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise (start where you are):</strong> begin with walking and strength basics; build toward weekly moderate activity plus resistance training. Avoid “crash” overtraining early.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 3 (Months 2–6): Targeted root-cause work (especially for Hashimoto’s)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Autoimmune strategy:</strong> reduce inflammatory triggers and support immune regulation—diet quality, vitamin D status, sleep, stress management, and gut health matter most.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured elimination trials (selective):</strong> if Hashimoto’s is present and symptoms persist, consider a time-limited, measurable trial of gluten reduction (and sometimes dairy reduction) guided by symptoms and follow-up labs. Screen for celiac disease before eliminating gluten if testing is planned.</li>
        <li><strong>Correct deficiencies:</strong> iron/ferritin, vitamin D, B12, zinc, and selenium can be “rate limiters” for energy and hair even if thyroid labs improve.</li>
        <li><strong>Review medication list:</strong> acid suppressants, bile binders, iron/calcium, and certain cardiac/psychiatric medications may affect thyroid physiology or absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower toxic load:</strong> implement a realistic, staged endocrine disruptor reduction plan (see dedicated section).</li>
        <li><strong>Re-test at the right intervals:</strong> thyroid dose changes take weeks to equilibrate; follow-up labs are most meaningful after a consistent period on a stable regimen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="treatments">Conventional treatments</h3>
      <p>
        The standard of care for overt hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement. For most people, levothyroxine
        (synthetic T4) is effective, safe, and stable. The most common reason people struggle is not the molecule itself,
        but inconsistent timing, absorption interference, or unaddressed contributors (iron deficiency, sleep apnea, inflammatory disease, etc.).

        <div class="rx-grid">
          <div class="rx-label">What it is</div>
          <div>
            Synthetic T4 replacement. Your body converts T4 to active T3 in peripheral tissues (especially liver and gut).
            It is the most commonly used and best-studied long-term therapy.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">How it works</div>
          <div>
            Restores circulating T4, allowing tissues to generate T3 as needed. Over time, this normalizes pituitary feedback (TSH)
            and improves metabolic function across systems.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Typical use</div>
          <div>
            Taken daily. Dose is individualized based on age, weight, cardiac risk, pregnancy status, symptoms, and follow-up labs.
            Consistency is the core skill: same time, same relationship to food and other medications.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Absorption rules</div>
          <div>
            Take with water on an empty stomach. Avoid taking it close to coffee or food. Separate from calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc,
            fiber supplements, soy protein, bile-acid binders, and certain antacids. If mornings are hard, bedtime dosing (well after food)
            can work when done consistently.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Side effects / risks</div>
          <div>
            When dosed correctly, side effects are uncommon. Over-treatment can cause palpitations, anxiety, insomnia,
            atrial fibrillation risk, and bone loss over time; under-treatment can leave symptoms and cardiometabolic risk unresolved.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Cost</div>
          <div>
            Often low-cost as a generic. Brand-name costs vary. The “true cost” often comes from repeated adjustments when absorption is inconsistent.

          <div class="rx-label">Why it can help</div>
          <div>
            Some formulations bypass dissolution issues and can be less sensitive to gastric pH changes. They may be useful when

          <div class="rx-label">Typical use</div>
          <div>

          <div class="rx-label">Side effects / risks</div>
          <div>

        antibodies over time in Hashimoto’s. The guiding rule is <strong>test when possible, avoid megadoses, and prioritize safety</strong>.

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Important safety principle:</strong> Supplements can meaningfully affect thyroid physiology and lab interpretation.
        They can also interact with anticoagulants, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, stimulants, and cardiac rhythm.

      <h4>Food sensitivities, gut health, and autoimmunity (selective but high-yield)</h4>
      <p>
        In Hashimoto’s, we often ask: what is keeping the immune system activated? The gut is a major immune interface,
        and gut inflammation or malabsorption can worsen symptoms and destabilize medication absorption.
      </p>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Celiac overlap:</strong> celiac disease is more common in Hashimoto’s than in the general population; screening is reasonable especially with GI symptoms, iron deficiency, or unstable thyroid dosing needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten trial (selective):</strong> if celiac testing is complete (or not indicated) and symptoms persist, a time-limited, measurable gluten reduction trial can be considered; focus on whole foods rather than highly processed “gluten-free” substitutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy trial (selective):</strong> sometimes considered when GI symptoms or inflammatory symptoms persist, especially if there is concurrent intolerance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Exercise, stress physiology, and sleep</h4>
      <p>
        Hypothyroidism disrupts sleep and energy, and poor sleep worsens metabolic and immune resilience. Build exercise gradually,
        avoid overtraining, and protect recovery. If you snore, wake unrefreshed, or have daytime sleepiness, sleep apnea screening is high-yield.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toxins">Lowering toxic load: practical endocrine disruptor reduction</h3>
      <p>
        Your thyroid system is sensitive to environmental chemicals that can disrupt endocrine signaling. Some exposures interfere with iodine handling
        or thyroid hormone transport; others interact at the receptor level or alter metabolism through inflammatory signaling.
        You do not need perfection. The goal is a <strong>reasonable, staged reduction</strong> in the most common and most modifiable exposures.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Conceptual anchor:</strong> Thyroid hormone function depends on (1) iodine availability and transport, (2) hormone synthesis, (3) conversion and tissue delivery,
        (4) receptor signaling, and (5) immune/inflammatory context. Endocrine disruptors can affect multiple steps at once—especially in genetically susceptible individuals.
      </div>

      <h4>Major thyroid-disrupting chemical categories (high-yield)</h4>
      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Bisphenols (BPA and “regrettable substitutes” like BPS/BPF):</strong> common in some plastics, can linings, and thermal receipts; can disrupt endocrine signaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Phthalates:</strong> common in fragranced products, some plastics/vinyl, and packaging; can interfere with hormone signaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Perchlorate:</strong> can contaminate water and some foods; competes with iodine uptake in the thyroid.</li>
        <li><strong>PFAS (“forever chemicals”):</strong> associated with stain-resistant treatments, some food packaging, and contaminated water sources; can affect endocrine and immune signaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Flame retardants (e.g., PBDEs):</strong> historically used in furniture and electronics; persist in house dust and may influence endocrine pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide residues:</strong> exposure varies by food choices and occupational/environmental context.</li>
        <li><strong>High fluoride exposure (context dependent):</strong> fluoride is a halogen; very high exposures can impact thyroid physiology in some contexts. The goal is not fear, but informed mitigation when exposure is high.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Practical exposure reduction strategies (high ROI)</h4>
      <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Start with the “big levers”:</strong> water, food storage/cooking, personal care products, and household dust.
      </div>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Water quality (highest leverage for many households):</strong> consider a high-quality filtration strategy if your local water profile is concerning.
          Reverse osmosis systems are commonly used when the goal is broad contaminant reduction. This is especially relevant if you have well water or known regional contaminant issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Food storage:</strong> store food and water in glass or stainless steel when feasible. Avoid microwaving food in plastic containers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookware:</strong> replace damaged non-stick cookware with stainless steel, cast iron, or other safer alternatives when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce thermal receipt exposure:</strong> minimize handling of receipts, especially before eating; wash hands after exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal care (fragrance is a major “hidden” category):</strong> choose fragrance-free products when possible; reduce the number of products used daily.</li>
        <li><strong>House dust and indoor air:</strong> vacuum regularly (HEPA filtration is helpful), wet-dust high surfaces, and ventilate indoor spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Food choices (risk-based approach):</strong> prioritize whole foods and consider organic options for produce known to carry higher pesticide residue—without turning nutrition into an anxiety project.</li>

      <h3 id="tracking">Targets and tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Your goal is stable physiology and stable function—not “chasing” single lab values. Track outcomes that matter and review them systematically.
      </p>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <strong>Track both biology and lived function:</strong> labs + symptoms + recovery + cardiometabolic markers. Many “thyroid problems” are actually absorption problems, deficiency problems, sleep problems, or stress physiology problems.
      </div>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Labs (as appropriate):</strong> TSH, free T4 (and antibodies if Hashimoto’s); consider lipids, ferritin/iron studies, B12, vitamin D, and A1c based on symptoms and risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Symptoms (weekly):</strong> energy (0–10), brain fog (0–10), constipation frequency, hair shedding pattern, cold intolerance, mood.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitals:</strong> resting pulse, blood pressure (if relevant), and subjective exercise tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> sleep duration, awakenings, and whether you wake refreshed; snoring or daytime sleepiness prompts sleep apnea screening.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication adherence quality:</strong> same time daily, separation from blockers, consistent formulation/manufacturer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="costs">Cost considerations</h3>
      <p>
        A cost-effective strategy is to prioritize interventions that most reliably improve outcomes: accurate diagnosis, consistent medication timing,
        sleep optimization, and treating common deficiencies. Many people overspend on supplements while missing high-yield basics.
      </p>

      <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Medication:</strong> generic levothyroxine is often low-cost; specialty formulations are best reserved for clear indications.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> focus on tests that change decisions—TSH/free T4 for management, antibodies for etiology, targeted labs for deficiencies and symptom mimics.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> use “one purpose per supplement,” avoid duplicates, and prefer correcting confirmed deficits rather than taking broad “thyroid stacks.”</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> whole foods are frequently the most cost-effective intervention. Packaged “special diets” can inflate costs without improving outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Toxin reduction:</strong> prioritize “big levers” first (water, cookware, storage, fragrance reduction) rather than expensive detox products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

      <h4>Why do I still feel hypothyroid if my TSH is “normal”?</h4>
      <p>
        Common reasons include inconsistent medication absorption (timing with coffee, calcium/iron/magnesium/zinc, fiber, or soy),
        unrecognized sleep apnea, iron deficiency, low vitamin B12 or vitamin D, depression/anxiety, insulin resistance,
        chronic inflammation, or other medical conditions. Less commonly, a carefully supervised combination-therapy trial may be considered
        after high-yield causes are addressed.
      </p>

      <h4>Do I need to avoid cruciferous vegetables or soy?</h4>
      <p>
        Most people do not need to avoid these foods. Cruciferous vegetables are typically beneficial, especially when cooked.
        Soy can be part of a healthy diet; the main issue is timing relative to thyroid medication because soy may reduce absorption
        if consumed too close to dosing.
      </p>

      <h4>Should I take iodine or kelp supplements for my thyroid?</h4>
      <p>
        In iodine-replete areas, high-dose iodine can worsen thyroid problems in susceptible individuals, especially with autoimmune thyroid disease.
        Aim for balanced dietary intake and avoid megadoses unless guided by testing and a clinician’s plan.
      </p>

      <h4>What is subclinical hypothyroidism, and does it require treatment?</h4>
      <p>
        Subclinical hypothyroidism means TSH is mildly elevated while free T4 is still normal—often a sign that the system is under strain.
        Management depends on symptoms, antibody status, pregnancy plans, and cardiovascular risk. Some people benefit from treatment;
        others do well with monitoring and lifestyle work.
      </p>

      <h4>What are the most important lifestyle levers?</h4>
      <p>
        Consistent sleep and circadian rhythm, protein and micronutrient sufficiency, reduced ultra-processed foods, gradual exercise progression,
        and stress regulation practices. For Hashimoto’s, gut health work, structured elimination trials, and toxin reduction may be helpful when targeted and measurable.
