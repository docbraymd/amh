        Migraine is not "just a bad headache"; it is a complex, genetic neurological disease characterized by a hyperexcitable brain. At Archangel Michael Health, we believe the most effective management combines rigorous internal medicine with the common-sense wisdom of lifestyle and integrative care. This guide is designed to help you move from passive suffering to active management by understanding your unique threshold for attacks and building physiological resilience.

      <h3 id="overview">Overview: The Migraine Brain</h3>
      <p>
        Current science views migraine as a state of sensory processing sensitivity. The migraine brain does not filter stimuli—light, sound, smell—as effectively as a non-migraine brain. This "hyperexcitability" means your threshold for a neurological event is lower. When that threshold is crossed, the trigeminovascular system activates, releasing inflammatory chemicals like CGRP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) that cause pain signals to bombard the brainstem.
      </p>
      <ul class="symptom-list">
        <li><strong>Key point:</strong> Migraine is a genetic "hardware" issue, often involving ion channel variances that affect how nerves fire.</li>
        <li><strong>Key point:</strong> Treatment is not just about killing pain; it is about raising your threshold so attacks occur less often.</li>
        <li><strong>Key point:</strong> "Treat Early" is the golden rule. Treating during the mild headache phase is far more effective than waiting for severe pain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="symptoms">Phases, Symptoms & Red Flags</h3>
      <h4>The Four Phases</h4>
      <p>A migraine attack is a dynamic event that can span days. Recognizing the early phases allows you to intervene before the pain becomes disabling.</p>
      <ul class="symptom-list">
        <li><strong>1. Prodrome (The Warning):</strong> Occurs 24–48 hours before pain. Symptoms include frequent yawning, neck stiffness, food cravings (sweets/carbs), mood changes, and increased urination.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Aura:</strong> Occurs in 25–30% of patients, typically lasting 5–60 minutes. Visual auras (zigzag lines, blind spots) are most common, but sensory aura (tingling hand/face) or speech difficulty can occur.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Headache (The Attack):</strong> Lasts 4–72 hours. Pain is often one-sided and throbbing, worsened by movement. Nausea and sensitivity to light/sound are hallmarks.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Postdrome (The Hangover):</strong> Lasts 24–48 hours after pain stops. Characterized by "brain fog," fatigue, and scalp tenderness.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert-box">
        <h4>Red Flags (SNOOP10 Criteria)</h4>
        <p>
          While migraines are not dangerous, certain headaches require urgent evaluation to rule out strokes, aneurysms, or infections. Seek immediate care for:
        </p>
        <ul class="symptom-list" style="margin-top:10px;">
            <li><strong>Thunderclap Headache:</strong> Sudden, severe pain reaching maximum intensity in seconds ("worst of life").</li>
            <li><strong>Systemic symptoms:</strong> Headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, or weight loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Neurological deficits:</strong> Weakness, confusion, seizure, or vision loss that does not resolve within 60 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Older Onset:</strong> New headache pattern starting after age 50.</li>
            <li><strong>Positional:</strong> Pain triggers specifically when standing up or lying down.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 id="drivers">Root Causes & Threshold Theory</h3>
      <p>
        We use the <strong>Threshold Theory</strong> to explain attacks. Imagine a bucket. Your genetics determine the size of the bucket. Triggers are the water filling it. When the bucket overflows, you get a migraine. You cannot change your genetics, but you can stop the bucket from overflowing by managing these drivers.
      </p>

        </div>
        <div class="rx-grid">
            <div class="rx-label">Stress Physiology</div>
            <div>The "Let-down" headache often occurs on weekends when cortisol drops rapidly after a stressful week. Consistency in stress management is key.</div>

            <div class="rx-label">Sleep</div>
            <div>The migraine brain craves routine. Too little sleep, too much sleep, or irregular wake times (even on weekends) are potent triggers.</div>

            <div class="rx-label">Medications</div>
            <div>Certain medications can lower the threshold or trigger attacks. <strong>Oral Contraceptives:</strong> Estrogen-containing birth control can trigger attacks and increase stroke risk in patients with aura. <strong>Vasodilators:</strong> Drugs like nitroglycerin or PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra/Cialis) are known triggers.</div>

            <div class="rx-label">Hormones</div>
            <div>Estrogen withdrawal just before menstruation triggers "menstrual migraine," which is often more severe and resistant to treatment.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 id="diet">Dietary Triggers: MSG, Cheese & Wine</h3>
      <p>
        While some food "triggers" (like chocolate) are actually prodrome cravings, certain chemical compounds in food are well-documented triggers for susceptible patients. Identifying and limiting these can significantly raise your migraine threshold.
      </p>

          <div class="rx-name">Key Chemical Triggers</div>
          <div class="rx-type">DIET</div>
        </div>
        <div class="rx-grid">
          <div class="rx-label">Tyramine (Aged Foods)</div>
          <div>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> A compound found in foods that have been aged, fermented, or stored for long periods.<br>
            <strong>Common Sources:</strong> Aged cheeses (Blue, Cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan), cured or smoked meats (salami, pepperoni), fermented soy (miso, tofu, soy sauce), and tap beer.<br>
            <strong>Mechanism:</strong> Tyramine can cause the release of norepinephrine, leading to vasoconstriction followed by rebound dilation and pain.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)</div>
          <div>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> A flavor enhancer used in processed foods and some restaurant cooking.<br>
            <strong>Common Sources:</strong> Canned soups, processed snacks (chips, flavored crackers), fast food, seasoning blends, and soy sauce.<br>
            <strong>Mechanism:</strong> Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. In a hyperexcitable migraine brain, excess glutamate can trigger the electrical cascade of an attack.
          </div>

          <div class="rx-label">Alcohol & Nitrates</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Alcohol:</strong> Red wine is the most frequent culprit due to tannins, sulfites, and phenolic flavonoids. Clear spirits (vodka, gin) are often better tolerated. Alcohol also causes dehydration.<br>
            <strong>Nitrates:</strong> Found in bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats. They are direct vasodilators that can immediately trigger vascular headaches.
          </div>

           <div class="rx-label">Aspartame</div>
          <div>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> An artificial sweetener found in "diet" sodas and sugar-free snacks.<br>
             <strong>Action:</strong> A reported trigger for many patients; consider switching to natural sweeteners or water if you consume high amounts of diet soda.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="clinical-note">
        <h4>Clinical Strategy</h4>
        <p>
          Do not restrict all these foods at once forever. We recommend a <strong>4-6 week elimination period</strong> of high-risk items (Tyramine, MSG, Nitrates). Reintroduce them one by one to see which specific chemical affects <em>your</em> brain. Hydration and stable blood sugar (never skipping meals) are just as important as avoiding specific foods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="plan">The "SEEDS" Improvement Plan</h3>
      <div class="success-box">
        <h4>What "Better" Looks Like</h4>
        <p>
          We define success as a 50% reduction in headache days, reduced attack severity, and improved response to acute medication. Complete cure is rarely the goal; management and resilience are.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Implementing the <strong>SEEDS</strong> protocol is the foundation of preventative care.</p>
      <ul class="symptom-list">
        <li><strong>S - Sleep:</strong> Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day. Screen for sleep apnea if you snore.</li>
        <li><strong>E - Exercise:</strong> Moderate aerobic exercise (30-50 mins, 3x/week) acts like a "natural beta-blocker" by burning off excess adrenaline.</li>
        <li><strong>E - Eat/Hydrate:</strong> Eat protein-rich meals every 3-4 hours to stabilize blood sugar. Drink 2-3L of water daily, adding electrolytes if you sweat.</li>
        <li><strong>D - Diary:</strong> Track attacks to identify patterns (weather, hormones, food) rather than guessing.</li>
        <li><strong>S - Stress:</strong> Use biofeedback or diaphragmatic breathing (4-7-8 method) to dampen the sympathetic nervous system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="acute">Acute Medications (Abortive)</h3>
      <p>
        Acute medications are taken to stop an attack that has already started. The most common error is waiting too long; treating while pain is mild significantly increases success.

      <h3 id="moh">Medication Overuse Headache (Rebound)</h3>
      <div class="amh-disclaimer" style="border-left-color: var(--danger);">
        <p><strong>The "Vicious Cycle" of Treatment:</strong> Paradoxically, the medications used to treat migraines can <em>cause</em> migraines if used too frequently. This is the most common cause of chronic daily headache.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) occurs when acute painkillers are taken so often that the brain becomes sensitized, leading to a "rebound" headache as soon as the medication wears off. This traps the patient in a cycle of taking more medication to treat the pain caused by the medication itself.
      </p>
      <ul class="symptom-list">
        <li><strong>The Limit:</strong> To prevent MOH, you must strictly limit acute medications (Triptans, Excedrin, NSAIDs, Opiates) to <strong>fewer than 10 days per month</strong> (or 2 days per week).</li>
        <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Frequent exposure to analgesics downregulates pain receptors, lowering your pain threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty to Treat:</strong> MOH is notoriously difficult because the only cure is stopping the offending medication. This often leads to a temporary, but significant, worsening of headaches ("withdrawal") before improvement occurs.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="clinical-note">
        <h4>Treatment Strategy</h4>
        <p>
          Managing MOH requires a "washout" period where acute medications are stopped. We often use a "bridge therapy" (such as a short course of steroids) to help you survive the withdrawal week while simultaneously starting a robust <strong>preventative medication</strong> to rebuild your threshold.
