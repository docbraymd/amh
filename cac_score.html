  <p>
    A Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score (also called a “CT calcium scan”) is a low-radiation CT test that
    measures calcified plaque in the coronary arteries. Calcium itself is not the “enemy”; it is typically a marker of
    past arterial injury and the body’s attempt to stabilize plaque. What matters clinically is what a positive CAC score
    confirms: <strong>coronary atherosclerosis is present</strong>. That finding is actionable because atherosclerosis is a
    systemic, decades-long disease that can often be slowed dramatically—and sometimes partially reversed—by targeting
    the underlying drivers (lipids, blood pressure, insulin resistance, inflammation, smoking, sleep, and lifestyle).
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Important:</strong> CAC is a <em>risk marker</em>, not a stress test. The next steps are driven by your symptoms,
    overall risk profile, and the specific CAC level—not the number alone.

  <h3 id="overview">Overview and key points</h3>

  <div class="success-box">
    <strong>How to use this guide:</strong> (1) Identify your CAC category and percentile, (2) decide whether additional
    testing is warranted (usually symptom-driven), and (3) treat the underlying atherosclerosis with an intensity that
    matches your risk—often with a “lifestyle-first + appropriate medications” approach.
  </div>

  <h4>What CAC measures (and what it does not)</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>CAC measures calcified plaque</strong> (stable “scar-like” plaque) and correlates with total plaque burden.</li>
    <li><strong>CAC does not directly measure soft plaque</strong> (lipid-rich, inflamed plaque that can rupture). You can have
        meaningful soft plaque even with a CAC of 0—especially at younger ages or with high-risk conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>A high CAC does not automatically mean a critical blockage</strong>. It means you have atherosclerosis.
        Whether you have flow-limiting stenosis is determined by symptoms and/or further testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Most heart attacks come from plaque rupture and clot</strong>, not from slowly “clogging” to 100%. Treatment
        focuses on stabilizing plaque biology, not just chasing anatomy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How the score is calculated</h4>
  <p>
    CAC is typically reported as an <strong>Agatston score</strong>, which weights both the <em>area</em> of calcium and its
    <em>density</em>. The scanner identifies calcium above a threshold density and sums calcification across the major
    coronary arteries (left main, LAD, LCX, RCA). The score is also often reported as an age/sex percentile, which can
    matter: a “low” absolute score may still be high relative to peers in younger individuals.
  </p>

  <h4>Interpretation by CAC category (high-yield)</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>CAC = 0:</strong> Very low short-term risk (“warranty period”), but not lifetime immunity. Focus on prevention.
        Statins are often deferred unless other high-risk features exist.</li>
    <li><strong>CAC 1–99:</strong> Early plaque. Risk is above zero; prevention intensity increases. Many patients benefit from
        at least moderate-intensity lipid-lowering and aggressive lifestyle optimization, especially if older, above the 75th
        percentile, or with additional risk enhancers.</li>
    <li><strong>CAC 100–399:</strong> Moderate plaque burden. Often treated with a “secondary prevention mindset” (aggressive
        LDL/ApoB lowering, blood pressure optimization, and consideration of aspirin if bleeding risk is low).</li>
    <li><strong>CAC ≥400:</strong> Extensive plaque. Risk is high enough that most clinicians treat as very high-risk and often
        involve cardiology for aggressive prevention and decisions about additional testing.</li>
    <li><strong>CAC ≥1000:</strong> A distinct “very high-risk” group. Treatment intensity typically matches chronic coronary
        disease/secondary prevention targets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why your score may rise even when you are improving (“statin paradox”)</h4>
  <p>
    CAC often increases over time—even with optimal therapy. This can reflect plaque stabilization: soft plaque becomes
    denser, more calcified, and less rupture-prone. For that reason, repeat CAC scans are not done frequently, and we do
    not “chase the number to zero.” We chase <strong>risk-factor control and plaque stability</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms and red flags</h3>
  <p>
    Many people with elevated CAC have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can reflect reduced blood flow
    (ischemia), plaque instability, rhythm disturbances, or other cardiac/pulmonary causes. The key is to treat symptoms as
    symptoms—do not rely on a CAC score (even a “good” one) to explain away concerning changes.
  </p>

  <h4>Common (but non-specific) symptoms that deserve evaluation</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
    <li><strong>Exertional chest pressure, tightness, heaviness, or burning</strong> (sometimes felt in the left arm, jaw, back, or
        upper abdomen).</li>
    <li><strong>Shortness of breath with exertion</strong> that is new or worsening.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced exercise capacity</strong> (you “run out of gas” sooner than expected).</li>
    <li><strong>Unexplained fatigue</strong> (particularly if exertional and new).</li>
    <li><strong>Palpitations</strong>, especially if accompanied by dizziness or breathlessness.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="alert-box">
    <strong>Red flags (same-day / emergency evaluation):</strong>
    Chest pain or pressure at rest or with minimal exertion; crescendo (worsening) chest discomfort; chest symptoms with
    sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, or radiation to arm/jaw/back; new shortness of breath at rest; fainting or
    near-fainting (especially with exertion); palpitations with lightheadedness.
  </div>

  <h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis and what to test</h3>
  <p>
    CAC is best viewed as an objective “receipt” that atherosclerosis is present. The clinical task is to (1) determine
    whether there is evidence of <strong>ischemia or unstable symptoms</strong> that warrants additional testing, and
    (2) identify the <strong>drivers</strong> of plaque so we can treat the disease biology.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 1: Review the CAC report carefully</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Total Agatston score</strong> and <strong>age/sex percentile</strong> (high percentile suggests accelerated disease).</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution by artery</strong> (left main involvement can carry higher concern; diffuse multi-vessel calcium
        implies broader plaque burden).</li>
    <li><strong>Incidental findings</strong> sometimes appear (lung nodules, aortic valve calcification). These are addressed
        separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 2: Baseline cardiometabolic testing (treat the biology)</h4>
  <p>
    A CAC score is a prompt to measure and improve the most actionable drivers of plaque: apoB-containing lipoproteins,
    inflammation, blood pressure load, glucose/insulin signaling, and lifestyle foundations.
  </p>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Lipid / particle risk:</strong> fasting lipid panel, non-HDL cholesterol, ApoB, and Lp(a) (once in adulthood,
        especially with family history).</li>
    <li><strong>Glycemic / metabolic risk:</strong> fasting glucose, HbA1c; consider fasting insulin and/or markers of insulin
        resistance when relevant.</li>
    <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> hs-CRP can help quantify residual inflammatory risk (interpret in context; infections and
        injuries can raise it).</li>
    <li><strong>Kidney / electrolytes:</strong> CMP (creatinine/eGFR, liver enzymes, electrolytes) to guide medication selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Blood pressure quality:</strong> home BP log (7 days, seated, standardized technique) is often more useful than
        one clinic reading.</li>
    <li><strong>Other risk enhancers (case-by-case):</strong> thyroid status, sleep apnea evaluation, urine albumin/creatinine,
        and secondary causes of dyslipidemia (as clinically indicated).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 3: When do we add cardiac tests beyond CAC?</h4>
  <p>
    Additional testing is usually driven by <strong>symptoms</strong>, a plan to begin vigorous exercise in higher-risk patients,
    unusual findings on the CAC report, or uncertainty about whether there is flow-limiting disease.

    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 id="drivers">Root causes and contributing factors</h3>
  <p>
    Atherosclerosis is not a “cholesterol-only” problem. It is a chronic injury-and-repair process in the artery wall.
    Cholesterol-containing particles and immune cells participate in the repair response; persistent injury keeps the
    process active, promoting growth of soft plaque and eventual calcification.
  </p>

  <h4>High-yield drivers (what we can often change)</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list symptom-list">
    <li><strong>ApoB particle burden:</strong> LDL and other ApoB-containing particles drive plaque growth. “Normal” LDL may be
        too high for your personal plaque biology when CAC is elevated.</li>
    <li><strong>Blood pressure load:</strong> Chronic shear stress damages the endothelial lining and accelerates plaque.</li>
    <li><strong>Insulin resistance / diabetes:</strong> High glucose and metabolic dysfunction increase oxidative stress and
        glycation, worsening vascular injury.</li>
    <li><strong>Tobacco exposure:</strong> A direct arterial toxin; “light” smoking and vaping still carry meaningful risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Periodontal disease, chronic stress, poor sleep, untreated sleep apnea, autoimmune disease,
        and visceral adiposity can amplify vascular inflammation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sedentary physiology:</strong> Low cardiorespiratory fitness worsens endothelial function and metabolic health.</li>
    <li><strong>Diet quality:</strong> Ultra-processed foods, refined sugars, and “industrial” fats can worsen lipids, insulin
        resistance, and inflammation; nutrient-dense whole-food patterns (Mediterranean or whole-food plant-forward) are
        consistently associated with lower event rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Risk enhancers that often change treatment intensity</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li>Strong family history of premature coronary disease</li>
    <li>Elevated Lp(a)</li>
    <li>Chronic kidney disease</li>
    <li>Inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis)</li>
    <li>Obstructive sleep apnea</li>
    <li>Persistent hypertriglyceridemia</li>
    <li>Premature menopause or a history of pregnancy-related vascular complications</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="plan">Step-by-step improvement plan</h3>
  <p>
    The goal is not simply to “have a lower CAC number.” The goal is to reduce near-term risk by stabilizing plaque and
    reducing the drivers that create new plaque. Your CAC score helps set the <strong>intensity</strong> of your prevention
    plan.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 0: Safety screen</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li>If you have <strong>red-flag symptoms</strong>, seek urgent evaluation regardless of CAC.</li>
    <li>If you have known coronary disease (prior heart attack, stent, bypass), CAC adds little—management follows chronic
        coronary disease standards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 1: Map your risk and choose targets</h4>
  <p>
    In Archangel Michael Health’s framework, higher CAC pushes us toward lower LDL/ApoB targets and more aggressive
    treatment of blood pressure, glucose, weight, and inflammation. Targets are individualized, but typical prevention
    goals for higher CAC are more stringent than standard “primary prevention.”
  </p>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Blood pressure:</strong> typically &lt;130/80 mmHg; in very high-risk patients, we may aim closer to a systolic
        around 120 if tolerated.</li>
    <li><strong>LDL-C and ApoB:</strong> mild CAC often targets LDL &lt;100; moderate CAC often targets LDL &lt;70; severe CAC often
        targets LDL &lt;55 with ApoB targets that match that intensity.</li>
    <li><strong>Triglycerides:</strong> ideally &lt;150 mg/dL; persistently higher values usually signal insulin resistance,
        alcohol effect, or genetic predisposition.</li>
    <li><strong>Glucose control:</strong> HbA1c and fasting glucose in an individualized healthy range; focus on insulin
        sensitivity rather than “normal labs with abnormal physiology.”</li>
    <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> address root causes (sleep, weight, periodontal health, exercise, stress); hs-CRP is one
        optional marker for tracking in context.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 2: Management by CAC category (what we typically do)</h4>

  <div class="rx-card">
    <div class="rx-header">
      <div class="rx-name">CAC = 0 (no detectable calcified plaque)</div>

      <div class="rx-label">Core plan</div>

      <div class="rx-label">Medication stance</div>
      <div>Often reasonable to defer statins unless you have diabetes, very high LDL, active smoking, strong family

  <h4>Step 3: Build your personal 90-day action plan (printable checklist)</h4>
  <p>
    Atherosclerosis responds best to consistent, repeatable behaviors. Choose a few high-leverage changes and execute them
    relentlessly.
  </p>

  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Nutrition (choose 3):</strong> ☐ Mediterranean pattern as default ☐ 30+ grams/day fiber (legumes, oats,
        psyllium) ☐ 2 servings/week fatty fish (or equivalent omega‑3 plan) ☐ replace refined carbs with minimally processed
        carbs ☐ eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages ☐ reduce ultra-processed snacks ☐ increase protein quality (fish, legumes,
        poultry) ☐ focus on olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado as primary fats</li>
    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> ☐ 150 minutes/week moderate aerobic OR 75 minutes vigorous (scaled to your level) ☐ 2
        strength sessions/week ☐ daily walking target ☐ consider supervised cardiac rehab if high risk or deconditioned</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> ☐ consistent sleep window ☐ 7–9 hours/night ☐ screen for sleep apnea if loud snoring, witnessed
        apneas, or persistent fatigue</li>
    <li><strong>Stress physiology:</strong> ☐ 10 minutes/day breathwork or mindfulness ☐ structured recovery days ☐ social
        connection/support</li>
    <li><strong>Risk toxins:</strong> ☐ no tobacco/nicotine ☐ alcohol within low-risk limits (or avoid if triglycerides, blood
        pressure, or sleep suffer) ☐ address periodontal health</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> ☐ home BP log weekly ☐ weight/waist monthly ☐ lipid/apoB recheck 8–12 weeks after changes
        ☐ symptom and exercise tolerance log</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="treatments">Conventional treatments</h3>
  <p>
    Medication decisions should match CAC-informed risk and your individual drivers (lipids, BP, glucose, inflammation).
    Most of the benefit comes from reducing ApoB particles, stabilizing plaque biology, and lowering thrombosis risk when
    appropriate.

  <h3 id="integrative">Integrative and lifestyle-first strategies</h3>
  <p>
    Integrative prevention is not “anti-medication.” It is <strong>stacking</strong> interventions: nutrition, movement, sleep,
    stress physiology, and evidence-informed supplements—layered on top of appropriate conventional therapy. Lifestyle is
    the foundation; supplements are <em>adjuncts</em>.
  </p>

  <h4>Nutrition: the highest ROI intervention</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Mediterranean pattern:</strong> vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains; olive oil as primary fat; fish
        regularly; minimal ultra-processed foods.</li>
    <li><strong>Whole-food plant-forward / Ornish-style:</strong> particularly effective for some patients with high LDL/ApoB
        and inflammatory patterns; emphasizes very low saturated fat and high fiber.</li>
    <li><strong>Insulin resistance strategy:</strong> for high triglycerides, fatty liver, or metabolic syndrome, focus on reducing
        refined carbs and liquid calories, increasing protein quality, and increasing activity after meals.</li>
    <li><strong>Practical “swap list”:</strong> beans/lentils instead of refined grains; fruit or yogurt instead of pastries; nuts
        instead of chips; olive oil and herbs instead of sugary sauces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Exercise: plaque biology and endothelial function</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Aerobic base:</strong> aim for consistent zone-2 style work (brisk walking, cycling) as the default.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength training:</strong> twice weekly supports insulin sensitivity and healthy body composition.</li>
    <li><strong>HIIT (optional):</strong> can be time-efficient; best introduced after an aerobic base is established. In higher CAC
        categories, progress gradually and consider stress testing or supervised rehab before vigorous programs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sleep and stress physiology</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> poor sleep raises BP, worsens glucose control, and increases appetite hormones. Treat sleep apnea
        when present—this is often a high-leverage “hidden driver.”</li>
    <li><strong>Stress:</strong> chronic sympathetic activation increases inflammation and impairs behavior change. A small daily
        stress practice (breathwork, prayer/meditation, nature walks) can be a meaningful biologic intervention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Evidence-informed supplement options (adjuncts)</h4>
  <p>
    Supplements can be useful when chosen with a clear goal, appropriate dosing, and attention to interactions. Quality
    matters. If you take anticoagulants, have kidney/liver disease, are pregnant, or are on complex medications, review
    supplements with your clinician.

  <h4>What we avoid in an evidence-informed practice</h4>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li>Replacing proven therapies (like statins when indicated) with supplements alone.</li>
    <li>Unmonitored high-dose fat-soluble vitamins without a clear indication.</li>
    <li>Frequent repeat CAC scanning as the primary feedback mechanism.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="costs">Cost considerations</h3>
  <p>
    Costs vary widely by region, insurance, and facility. The goal is to spend money where it buys meaningful risk reduction:
    high-value labs, high-yield lifestyle interventions, and medications with strong outcomes data when indicated.
  </p>
  <ul class="amh-list">
    <li><strong>CAC scan:</strong> often a few hundred dollars cash-pay (varies by market).</li>
    <li><strong>Core labs:</strong> lipid panel and metabolic panel are usually low-cost; ApoB and Lp(a) may be additional.</li>
    <li><strong>Stress testing:</strong> treadmill ECG tends to be less expensive than imaging stress tests; nuclear testing is often
        higher cost.</li>
    <li><strong>CCTA:</strong> moderate-to-high cost; includes contrast and advanced imaging interpretation.</li>
    <li><strong>Cardiac catheterization:</strong> high cost and invasive; reserved for situations where it is likely to change care.</li>
    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> many foundational therapies are inexpensive generics; newer lipid and metabolic agents may be
        expensive without coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> costs add up quickly; we prioritize a small number of high-leverage adjuncts (if any) over large
        “stacks.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

  <h4>Should I repeat my CAC scan to see if I’m improving?</h4>
  <p>
    Usually not soon. CAC can rise even with good therapy due to plaque stabilization. We typically track improvement using
    biomarkers (LDL/ApoB, BP, A1c/insulin resistance markers), fitness, symptoms, and weight/waist—then consider repeat CAC
    only if it will meaningfully change decisions.
  </p>

  <h4>If I have a high score, do I automatically need a stent?</h4>
  <p>
    No. CAC confirms atherosclerosis but does not prove a flow-limiting blockage. Stents are most beneficial for acute heart
    attacks or persistent limiting angina despite optimal medical therapy. Many stable patients do best with aggressive
    lifestyle + medications.
  </p>

  <h4>Can I have a heart attack with a CAC score of 0?</h4>
  <p>
    Yes, although risk is low. CAC of 0 does not rule out non-calcified plaque, spasm, clotting disorders, or non-coronary
    causes. Symptoms always override CAC.
  </p>

  <h4>Does high calcium mean I should stop calcium supplements or avoid dietary calcium?</h4>
  <p>
    Not necessarily. Vascular calcium is part of plaque biology, not simply “too much dietary calcium.” Decisions about
    calcium supplements depend on bone health, diet, and kidney stone risk. We individualize this discussion and often focus
    more on vitamin D status, magnesium intake, and overall cardiometabolic control than on calcium avoidance.
  </p>

  <h4>What is the single best thing I can do?</h4>
  <p>
    For most patients: eliminate tobacco exposure, build a sustainable whole-food nutrition pattern, improve fitness, and
    lower ApoB particle burden to an appropriate target for your CAC level—often the most powerful combination.
